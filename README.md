Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

 The Gaming Room wants to create a multi-platform web based game based on their current Android game titled “Draw It or Lose It”. The game needs to serve multiple clients and platforms. Each game will have one or more teams involved, each team will have multiple players assigned to it. Game and team names must be unique, and should allow users to check if a name is in use. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at a time.
 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did well in knowing the clients problems and clearly stating them on the design documentation.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful part of the design process when it comes to developing code is the UML diagram.




If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would revise my recomendations. I can be more detailed in them and add some more effort. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I took the most basic terrms of their needs and expanded on them to find the best option for them. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    For designing the software, I started with basic and moved to more complex. Separating the clients requirements into different goals is a good strategy.
